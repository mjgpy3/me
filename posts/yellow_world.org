A couple days a year
After muggy summer heat
The setting sun paints the world sepia

These days
In their rare splendor
Remind me that life's like an old photograph

Colors decay
Edges wear down
We're converging on a mellow respite

Nothing breaks this
Nothing hides it
A device is hard pressed to distract us from its beauty

We're tempted to reflect
We ponder fearing the future
But we can't for veneration of this wonderful moment

As sepia turns to orange turns to gold turns to dark purple
