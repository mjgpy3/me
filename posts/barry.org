I am not that swift little progeny; listless, flowering throughout
(Claims Barry)
Turn now won returns and fold your hands until lit cards disintegrate

I inch inward, inclining irises immediately -- indeed -- intently illumined in interest
(Barry notices)
Bargaining in that big brain, without my knowing, Barry will burp a laugh -- that maniac

Barry can barely bare the baritone bereavements of the barreling bare bear
(He's had a long day)
Established is he, the lad at the blessed stable, lashed lest he bled
