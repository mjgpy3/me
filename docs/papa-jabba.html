<pre class="example">
I am Papa Jabba 
Salacious at my side
I eat candied bugs (and sugared slugs)
Too proud to see my pride

I'm the belly-full American
Well rounded in every way
Welcome to the sty (in which I lie)
I hope you choose to stay

My clothes are gold and sliver
Made by fingers worked to bone
I have dainty silk (that's white as milk)
You should hear my servants groan

I'm the most humblest philanthropist
There's so much I want to give
And I will give it (without a fit)
After I've taken more time to live 

I truly value your opinion
Your advice I want to cherish
I want to hear what you say (though I look away)
And my face expresses want to perish

For all is for my 'tainment
No one is exempt
You want to be free (but believe me)
Futile is the attempt

The world's for my devouring
I leave no soul unturned
I've fifteen million merits (in sticks and carrots)
Shopping for bridges to be burned

I am Papa Jabba

I am Papa Jabba

I am Papa Jabba

Others may be Papa Jabba too

But I'm the most Papa Jabba
