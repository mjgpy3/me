  <title><![CDATA[October Challenges Conclusion]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
It's October 31 and what a month it has been! Today, as my last writing exercise of the month, I'm writing the conclusion to my <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/overly-ambitious-october-challenges.html">Overly Ambitious October Challenge</a> series.
</p>

<p>
These challenges have certainly been enriching. As I mentioned in my <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/october-goal-update-1.html">earlier update</a>, these have been difficult to maintain, but they've been nonetheless rewarding. So let's review where I landed with each one.
</p>

I completed my first Inktober! This was a lot more fun than I expected. I plan on writing a separate post with a scan of each drawing.
</p>

<p>
I may continue this challenge in a different form. Trying to draw a random Wikipedia article each day could be an interesting exercise.

I managed to land, record, and publish, a trick for each day of the month. Due to weather and time constraints, as expected, I did many of these tricks in the same few sessions. I believe it took four sessions in all to complete the tricks.
</p>

<p>
All the tricks are in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97kkzI__pGzvRuON8V_JSRg2VgGON7jc">YouTube playlist</a>.

<p>
This month I read, in entirety
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Making Comics</i></li>
<li><i>As a Man Thinketh</i></li>
<li><i>I, Robot</i>, and</li>
<li><i>The Storm Before the Storm</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Though I didn't fully complete a fifth book, I also read
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1/3 of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> (quite a feat in itself)</li>
<li>Some <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> aloud to my family</li>
<li>2/3 of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i></li>
<li>1/2 of <i>The Story of My Life</i> (Helen Keller's autobiography)</li>
<li>a little bit of <i>The Two Towers</i> (which I've been reading aloud for some time now)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This goal was wonderful and I hope to continue the pace of reading about a book a week. Of course, engaging with longer books may make this challenging.

I managed to take a unique photograph every day. Figuring out what to photograph (e.g. capturing "the right moment") was far more challenging than I expected. I plan on publishing the photos in a separate post.

I will not be continuing this challenge but will continue to take ad hoc photos.

I managed to avoid alcohol for the entire month! This was good because it definitely helped (1) improve my quality of sleep, and, thereby, (2) made me more successful in other challenges. This was really only difficult when I was at events where alcohol was served.

I did write a little bit of code in my private, Dominion (card game) tracking repository. I also wrote some code to play with the evaluator in "Why Calculating is better than scheming".

This challenge was good but I don't plan on continuing it. Writing is fun and I certainly need to practice it more. Daily writing goals just didn't really do it for me though. I don't feel like I gained a lot and mostly just sped through my writing activities.

This was a good challenge though it was one of the most difficult to keep up. I tended to overdo it on certain days making consecutive days more difficult. This ended up being a pretty even split of (1) body weight training, (2) intense skateboarding sessions, and (3) using a body weight exercise dice.

I will certainly keep up the body weight training but will not do as many days consecutively in the future.

This challenge was very easy. To be frank, I tended to put an album on when I did something else. So I certainly wasn't 100% engaged with 100% of 100% of the albums. However, I did "listen to them".
</p>

Here's what I heard

As a little bonus, I'm throwing in a challenge that I mostly accomplished accidentally. I ended up waking up at 7am every day (except today)!

This proved to be quite an interesting month. I mostly enjoyed the challenges and they certainly kept me busy. Given enough free time, I'm not sure I would do another month like this again. Though I've accomplished a lot, trying to fit it all in was a bit overwhelming at times, especially on busier days.

  <title><![CDATA[Nostalgia Beans]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<pre class="example">
The other day I grabbed a handful of jelly beans
From my kids' candy basket
The flavors were familiar
Though danties were dormant
They brought me back to times past

Orange - Orange
Reminds me of getting sick after drinking an orange julius.

Yellow - Lemon
Reminds me of eating lemon marange pie at Mimi's with my great grandmother.
She thought I stole her pie -- she missed that I ordered the same.

Green - Watermelon
Reminds me of eating sour patch kids with my cousin, driving to the beach.

Black - Licorice
Reminds me of how much I used to dislike this flavor. Because of this I like it now.

White - Pineapple
Reminds me of having my teeth operated on at the dentist's office.
This tastes exactly like the numbing agent they used.

Purple - Grape
Reminds me of taking communion as a child -- grape juice.

Pink - Strawberry
Reminds me of eating airheads at Halloween.
Hard to place exactly when.

Red - Cherry
Reminds me of Easter with my family -- my childhood home.

  <title><![CDATA[Dogman]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<pre class="example">
I read a fantasy novel
It had a character called Dogman
Dogman's what they used to call Saint Christopher
They say his people had heads like those of dogs

What kind of a world was that?
Were the dogfaced people a myth?
Did Christopher just look unattractive?

The point is
Honestly
Ancients said dogfaced people were real
They believed it
Some knew it

Does this even seem possible in these days?
Is it even believable that people believed this?
Where has the wonder gone?
Where to O' mystical?
Where wonder?

They are gone

They have been replaced by brutal and blunt material

On the neck of wonder rests the boot of capital

  <title><![CDATA[October Challenges Update 1]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Now that it's the 10th, I figured it'd be a good time to post an update on my October challenges! So far they're going well, though it has been difficult to maintain.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/overly-ambitious-october-challenges.html">original post</a> for more details on exactly what each challenge entails and each challenge's rubric for success.
</p>

<p>
Let's step through were we're at with each challenge.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org23f7764" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org23f7764">Challenges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org23f7764">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org98eb145" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org98eb145">Inktober (AKA Drawtober)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org98eb145">
<p>
I'm pretty happy with my results so far for this challenge. I'm especially happy as one who isn't all that "artistic". I've mostly drawn items from around my house or tried to draw the art of others (for practice, of course). A the end of the month I'll post all may drawings but so far I've managed to do a doodle every day!
</p>

<p>
Here are some teasers of my doodles from the last 9 days:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Bug-car" from kids' toy</li>
<li>Schema cross</li>
<li>Spooky Pooky</li>
<li>Big Daddy</li>
<li>Penguin &amp; Lil' Pookie</li>
<li>Hobbes stuffie</li>
<li>Endurance</li>
<li>Crest</li>
<li>Lukhimov Ent</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org421e048">
<p>
This challenge has also been a success so far. I certainly haven't been skating as much as usual but I've managed to do "a trick per day". I <span class="underline">have</span> clustered these into a few sessions but that's perfectly acceptable from the challenge description.
</p>

<p>
Here's a playlist of the tricks completed so far: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97kkzI__pGzvRuON8V_JSRg2VgGON7jc">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97kkzI__pGzvRuON8V_JSRg2VgGON7jc</a>

This has been good. My only problem has been that I've often delayed the question until the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
So far my questions have been:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is there a deeper meaning of <i>Blood Meridian</i>?</li>
<li>How did chess come about and develop?</li>
<li>Why do we say "turn over a new leaf"?</li>
<li>Who is "Katari" in Brendan's Death Song?</li>
<li>What is the difference between a crocodile and an alligator?</li>
<li>Where does ALDI USA's food come from?</li>
<li>Why do some classics have names/places blanked out?</li>
<li>What is second person and does anything use it?</li>
<li>How did people greet each other before "hello"?</li>
<li>When is the best time to eat protein (relative to exercise)?</li>
</ul>

<p>
I may later elaborate on each question and post some of the answers I've found.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89cc947">

I'm actually ahead of schedule with this one. Since I skated for a while on Sunday I've counted it as a workout which means I've got a few extra skips saved up.

This is going well so far. Aside from a quick daily checkup of email and whatnot I've only been using the internet for very specific purposes. I'm wasting very little time browsing the web which feels great. I may try to make a standard around this challenge &#x2013; we'll see.

So far so good. I've been counting some very long walks (e.g. we went to the zoo for a few hours) as two walks. This may be cheating but it's hard to get out on a walk in a cold, rainy day.

This challenge is really difficult to quantify. It's kind of fuzzy and I'm sure I've missed opportunities or been pessimistic on auto-pilot. I think I'm going to do a longer more thought up write up on this at the end of the month. One thing I will say is that the challenge has made me a little more introspective which is, of course, a good outcome.

  <title><![CDATA[Overly Ambitious October Challenges]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I have long been a fan of 30 day challenges. 30 days is the perfect amount of time to try something new or stretch yourself. This October I have the invaluable blessing of having some time on my hands. I'm going to try out a bunch of October challenges and see how I fare.
</p>

<p>
I have in mind 28 challenges some of which are well known, some are novel. I don't expect to deliver on 100% of these challenges, however, I will give myself partial credit where applicable.
</p>

<p>
So, here are the challenges!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd019ec6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd019ec6">Challenges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd019ec6">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2182c9f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2182c9f">Inktober (AKA Drawtober)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2182c9f">
<p>
This is a well-known October challenge. The goal is to draw something, absolutely anything, each day. The drawing can be simple or complicated.
</p>

<p>
This challenge is meant to be a streak so missed days cannot be made up. For example, doing two drawing in one day then skipping a day still counts as a miss for the skip.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8075324" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8075324">Skateober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8075324">
<p>
The idea of this challenge is to do a different trick for every day of the month &#x2013; so 31 tricks.
</p>

<p>
Since the weather is temperamental where I live, I'm going to allow for skips. For example, I would consider this a success if I did all the tricks in two sessions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org68b80a8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org68b80a8">Booktober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org68b80a8">
<p>
Read 4 books in October.
</p>

<p>
I will also count books that I end up reading aloud (see <a href="#orgb258ae6">Voictober</a> later).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc847236" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc847236">Photober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc847236">
<p>
This is a photography variant of Inktober. It's also meant to be a streak so skipped days can't be made up. Photos must vary somewhat.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4a2ac56" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4a2ac56">Psalmtober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4a2ac56">
<p>
Pray the entire Psalter in October. This could be clustered if need be but daily prayer is preferred.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org047a43e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org047a43e">Sober October</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org047a43e">
<p>
No alcohol consumption in the month.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org67c1ca8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67c1ca8">Hasktober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org67c1ca8">
<p>
Have some interaction with the Haskell programming language 31 times in October.
</p>

<p>
This may include
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>writing a little code</li>
<li>modifying an existing program</li>
<li>trying a new library</li>
<li>reading a Haskell paper</li>
<li>writing about Haskell</li>
<li>recording a video about Haskell</li>
<li>etc&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
This will not be streak-based.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4cac65e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4cac65e">Writober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4cac65e">
<p>
Write something every day.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to keep this kind of fuzzy but I'll know if I've met it or not. This is another "streak-based" goal (e.g. skipped days are losses).
</p>

<p>
For example, today (Oct. 1) I'm counting this article since I've made many edits, additions, and removals.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6207586" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6207586">YouTober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6207586">
<p>
Publish a video for each day in October.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I can leverage other challenges for this one (e.g. <a href="#org8075324">Skateober</a>).
</p>

<p>
I use the word "publish" because I will allow for publishing videos that I've already recorded (I have a handful that need editing).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org88fff18" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org88fff18">Langtober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88fff18">
<p>
Practice DuoLingo every day.
</p>

<p>
This shouldn't be too difficult. Again this will be streak-based and "streak freezes" (a DuoLingo feature that allows you to skip a day) won't count.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org98c7873" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org98c7873">Musictober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org98c7873">
<p>
Practice a musical instrument for 30 minutes a day. This will probably be non-streak-based so, for example, an hour may count for two days.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1e55d1e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1e55d1e">Curiousitober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1e55d1e">
<p>
Come up with and answer 1 interesting question per day. This is streak-based.
</p>

<p>
Here "interesting" is quite relative, of course.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge8c69d7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge8c69d7">Exertober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge8c69d7">
<p>
Exercise 6 days a week for the month. This will allow for 4 "skip" days for resting.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to count short walks (from <a href="#orgbe5ba09">Walktober</a>) as satisfying this challenge.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org31a5486" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org31a5486">Unplugtober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org31a5486">
<p>
No internet-connected devices, except where necessary for other challenges.
</p>

<p>
Some exceptions that come to mind
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hasktober will require the internet often (e.g. to read docs)</li>
<li>YouTober will require the internet to publish videos</li>
<li>Curiositober will likely require the internet to find answers</li>
<li>Gametober may require internet usage to look up rules</li>
<li>Inktober may benefit from having internet to access "inspiration" (e.g. subjects to draw)</li>
<li>Writober will afford short internet usage to publish posts (e.g. this one)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I will also allow myself a single email/chat check a day since I have obligations that require the use of email. I will also exempt any financial internet sessions that may arise (usually these are few, short, and necessary).
</p>

<p>
The spirit of this challenge is to limit my internet usage to one or two, targeted (and hopefully short) sessions per day.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe5ba09" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbe5ba09">Walktober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe5ba09">
<p>
Go on a walk (or run) outside every day. I'd prefer this to be daily but will allow for some "double day walks" or very long walks to count for two (again, due to weather).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb258ae6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb258ae6">Voictober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb258ae6">
<p>
Read a book aloud.
</p>

<p>
If finished, I will count this as a point towards <a href="#org68b80a8">Booktober</a> too.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1bd263b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1bd263b">Cooktober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1bd263b">
<p>
Cook something each day. "Recipes" can be repeated infinitely.
</p>

<p>
This challenge has two goals, in priority of
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>to cook for my family</li>
<li>cooking practice</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since this will be tough for me I would definitely count multiple recipes in a single day as multiple days. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge6ba6a3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge6ba6a3">Thriftober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge6ba6a3">
<p>
Unless necessary spending or challenge-related, spend less than $31 in October. I don't foresee any spending for these challenges.
</p>

<p>
If I went over $31 I'll need to figure out a partial credit mechanism, however, I hope I won't need to do that.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1d8e010" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1d8e010">Churchtober</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1d8e010">
<p>
Go to every church service in October.

This will be quite a challenge as there are many services.

Play 31 distinct games in October. Video games are not allowed. Multiples are acceptable in a single day and skips are okay.

Here "distinct" is a little flexible. Some games have the same underlying engine, however, allow for enough variance to produce a game that feels entirely different. For example, Dominion's kingdom randomization makes for highly diverse games.

  <description><![CDATA[
<pre class="example">
A couple days a year
After muggy summer heat
The setting sun paints the world sepia

These days
In their rare splendor
Remind me that life's like an old photograph

Colors decay
Edges wear down
We're converging on a mellow respite

Nothing breaks this
Nothing hides it
A device is hard pressed to distract us from its beauty

We're tempted to reflect
We ponder fearing the future
But we can't for veneration of this wonderful moment

As sepia turns to orange turns to gold turns to dark purple

  <description><![CDATA[
<pre class="example">
I am Papa Jabba 
Salacious at my side
I eat candied bugs (and sugared slugs)
Too proud to see my pride

I'm the belly-full American
Well rounded in every way
Welcome to the sty (in which I lie)
I hope you choose to stay

My clothes are gold and sliver
Made by fingers worked to bone
I have dainty silk (that's white as milk)
You should hear my servants groan

I'm the most humblest philanthropist
There's so much I want to give
And I will give it (without a fit)
After I've taken more time to live 

I truly value your opinion
Your advice I want to cherish
I want to hear what you say (though I look away)
And my face expresses want to perish

For all is for my 'tainment
No one is exempt
You want to be free (but believe me)
Futile is the attempt

The world's for my devouring
I leave no soul unturned
I've fifteen million merits (in sticks and carrots)
Shopping for bridges to be burned

I am Papa Jabba

I am Papa Jabba

I am Papa Jabba

Others may be Papa Jabba too

But I'm the most Papa Jabba

  <title><![CDATA[How I Learned Rock To Fakie]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
<i>4 minute read</i> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICj6qQPXnkQ">Video Version</a> 
</p>

<p>
I found Rock To Fakie to be an elusive trick. Looking back through my skating log, it took 3 months (to the day) for me to land my first one. If my books are correct, I practiced this trick for 53 sessions before landing! Though I usually wouldn't <i>only</i> practice Rock To Fakie in a session, that's still a lot of sessions!
</p>

<p>
So, how did I manage to finally land one? Let's get into it.
</p>

<p>
For starters, I watched every trick tip video I could find. The videos that stood out were:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabaAivHplc">Ben Degros' video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTtRbd8FwfM">The Skate Park Lessons' video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04FwNWlM6ZM">Sketchy Dave's video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUtYR-K1UP0">Never Stop Improving's video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bElNF5oL1XQ">Trog Army's video</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I dissected these videos among others. I scoured various web forums and even got a few tips from friends. All this was to no avail. Let's walk through some of the tips I encountered and why they didn't work for me.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd0c3586" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd0c3586">Taps and Lifts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd0c3586">
<p>
In trick tip videos, skaters recommend doing little taps. Doing these higher and higher up the ramp while going fakie should lead to Fakie Tail Stall makes. This actually worked out great for me. I got a few little Tail Taps on the coping after a few sessions which evolved into full stalls in short order.
</p>

<p>
Supposedly, doing little tail taps (or lifts) right before going fakie teach you how to lift the board. This lift is the last part of a Rock To Fakie. This didn't work out for me.
</p>

<p>
The forward lifts got comfortable for me. They lead to consistent Uptowns (an underrated trick) and Manual To Fakies. Though comfortable, These lifts didn't seem to help my Rock To Fakies. Whenever I'd try an actual Rock to Fakie something in my weight distribution was way off. I couldn't seem to correct it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org64ca0d0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org64ca0d0">Eyes and Shoulders</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org64ca0d0">
<p>
Some videos claim that the key elements to this trick are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping your shoulders perpendicular to the ramp and</li>
<li>keeping your eyes looking where you want to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Keeping your shoulders straight is important but there's some give here. It's clear to me now that shoulder placement wasn't blocking me from learning the trick. Regarding eyes, when I thought about where I was looking I tended to over-think it. This made for some silly (and painful) attempts.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0a46b80" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0a46b80">Confidence 80/20</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0a46b80">
<p>
Many resources claim that, in actuality, your form only makes up 20% of your ability to execute the trick. The other 80%? Confidence. This may be true for some but it wasn't for me. The "just be confident" advice tends to feel like "just do the thing" advice. Though well-meaning, it is superficially useful. I had a mental block. Hoping for a burst of confidence wasn't cutting through it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org888e89d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org888e89d">Other Little Tricks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org888e89d">
<p>
I tried many other tricks (in many a combination) including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>being loud &#x2013; both shouting and loudly slamming the rock</li>
<li>doing the trick on the exhale &#x2013; exhales being calming actions</li>
<li>leaning farther back</li>
<li>steeper ramps</li>
<li>more mellow ramps</li>
<li>smaller ramps</li>
<li>long sessions and short sessions</li>
<li>trying the trick alone and in combos</li>
<li>closing my eyes</li>
<li>wearing more pads &#x2013; to try to gain confidence</li>
<li>likely a few other tactics that escape me now</li>
</ul>

<p>
Through all this my right hip screamed for vengeance &#x2013; it took a ton of slams!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org20cfb74" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org20cfb74">What Worked For Me</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org20cfb74">
<p>
In the midst of battling Rock To Fakies, I learned Rock And Rolls (R&amp;Rs). I got the breakthrough for R&amp;Rs from a Never Stop Improving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIsJM8v01uI">video</a>. In that video, Justin demonstrates "stabbing" the board forward (a little tap) then kick turning back into the ramp. Doing this gradually up the ramps, you eventually hit the coping. A little later you find you're doing it above the coping and viola! You can Rock And Roll. These little baby R&amp;Rs slowly become real rocks then legendary decked R&amp;Rs as you push your abilities, a bit at a time. This was the same incremental approach that worked for me for finally making Rock To Fakies.
</p>

<p>
The steps in my thought process were: ride up, stab the ramp (do a tap), the pull the board up (as in do a "lift") and ride away. Thinking of the motion as an actual "stabbing" of the board was key, it changed my entire perspective on the trick. I did this stab higher and higher until I started to stab the coping. Then, putting a slight bit more speed behind it, I found I was doing the stab above the coping. A small but sure Rock To Fakie! These Rock To Fakies grew with practice in the exact same way that R&amp;Rs did. Now I can deck them out, land them on bigger ramps and do some odd variants.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org50e1c37" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org50e1c37">Don't Discount The Other Tips</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org50e1c37">
<p>
I stand by the assertion that the Never Stop Improving video provided the breakthrough for me. Though this is true, I can't discount the other tips mentioned herein. It's hard to say what they contributed to my progress while learning Rock To Fakies &#x2013; They all played a part in the journey. Also, we all know that everyone learns differently. The Never Stop Improving video got <i>me</i> over the hurdle &#x2013; but I'm curious &#x2013; what was your journey to Rock To Fakies like?

<pre class="example">
I am not that swift little progeny; listless, flowering throughout
(Claims Barry)
Turn now won returns and fold your hands until lit cards disintegrate

I inch inward, inclining irises immediately -- indeed -- intently illumined in interest
(Barry notices)
Bargaining in that big brain, without my knowing, Barry will burp a laugh -- that maniac

Barry can barely bare the baritone bereavements of the barreling bare bear
(He's had a long day)
Established is he, the lad at the blessed stable, lashed lest he bled

  <title><![CDATA[This Is Not a Blog]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Over a decade ago I read a post saying that <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-blog-without-comments-is-not-a-blog/">a blog without comments is not a blog</a>. Although I agree with some of the points made therein, I will not be enabling comments on this blog.
</p>

<p>
Interested in why? Here's a snapshot of emails I get about my old blog:
</p>


<figure id="org66516aa">
<img src="assets/new-comment-emails.png" alt="new-comment-emails.png">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Comments added emails</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Can you guess the content of 100% of those comments? Ads &#x2013; walls of links &#x2013; many of which are pornographic in nature. What a waste of time and bits. I won't be adding comments to this blog because there are other ways to contact me than below my posts.
</p>

<p>
For example, you could create a github account and <a href="https://github.com/mjgpy3/me/issues">open an issue in the blog's source</a>. Or if you have something pressing to discuss you could email me at <code>michael (dot) does (dot) stuff (at sign) protonmail (dot) com</code>.
</p>

<p>
Cheers, hope you enjoy reading this "not a blog."

  <title><![CDATA[Making Russian Flashcards for Reading]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I have a lifetime goal to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov"><i>The Brothers Karamazov</i></a> in the original Russian. I wanted to build out some Russian flashcards and I figured what better way to determine what words to use than the text of the book I want to read!
</p>

<p>
To start, I found a text file containing the Russian text of the book. This wasn't too difficult since the book's long past it's copyright. I essentially searched for "братья Карамазовы PDF" (the name of the book in Russian, followed by "PDF"). Lo and behold, I found a text copy from this search. All the better, no need to extract the text from a PDF!
</p>

<p>
I stored the text in a file called <code>brothers-k.txt</code> then wrote a little Python script to sort the words by frequency&#x2026;
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #5180b3;">import</span> re

<span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Build a regular expression to grab Russian words</span>

<span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Read in the file</span>
<span style="color: #5180b3;">with</span> <span style="color: #528fd1;">open</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span><span style="color: #bdbc61;">'./brothers-k.txt'</span>, <span style="color: #bdbc61;">'r'</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span> <span style="color: #5180b3;">as</span> f:
  <span style="color: #baba36;">raw_text</span> = f.read<span style="color: #81b0e3;">()</span>

<span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Store words as a mapping from word to frequency</span>
<span style="color: #baba36;">freqs</span> = <span style="color: #81b0e3;">{}</span>

<span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Loop through results of regex</span>
<span style="color: #5180b3;">for</span> word <span style="color: #5180b3;">in</span> <span style="color: #528fd1;">list</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span>word.findall<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">(</span>raw_text<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">)</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>:
  <span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Sanitize (lowercase) word so capitalization doesn't matter as much</span>
  <span style="color: #baba36;">low</span> = word.lower<span style="color: #81b0e3;">()</span>

  <span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Count unique words</span>
  <span style="color: #baba36;">freqs</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">[</span>low<span style="color: #81b0e3;">]</span> = freqs.get<span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span>low, <span style="color: #ab75c3;">0</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span> + <span style="color: #ab75c3;">1</span>

<span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">Print out count with word</span>
<span style="color: #5180b3;">for</span> word <span style="color: #5180b3;">in</span> <span style="color: #528fd1;">sorted</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span>freqs, key=<span style="color: #5180b3;">lambda</span> v: freqs<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">[</span>v<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">]</span>, reverse=<span style="color: #ab75c3;">True</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>:
  <span style="color: #5180b3;">print</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span>freqs<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">[</span>word<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">]</span>, word<span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I ran this script like so to generate <code>words.txt</code>&#x2026;
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">./extract_words.py &gt; words.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This file contains about 35,000 words that look something like&#x2026;
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-txt">14292 и
6863 в
6814 не
...
879 алеша
...
вечное 1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I then wrote a little shell script to output an English translation of the word, using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo's</a> translation API. To figure out the API details I&#x2026;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>entered a word into the translation service,</li>
<li>opened the Network tab,</li>
<li>right-clicked the request, then</li>
<li>choose "Copy &gt; Copy as CURL"</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's the translation script, with some details omitted (using <code>...</code>) for brevity. Note that this script uses <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"><code>jq</code></a> to extract the translated value.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #656565;">#</span><span style="color: #757575;">!/usr/bin/</span><span style="color: #5180b3;">env</span><span style="color: #757575;"> bash</span>

<span style="color: #baba36;">ru_word</span>=$<span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span><span style="color: #fa8072;">echo</span> $<span style="color: #ab75c3;">1</span> | cut -d <span style="color: #bdbc61;">' '</span> -f <span style="color: #ab75c3;">2</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>
<span style="color: #baba36;">count</span>=$<span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span><span style="color: #fa8072;">echo</span> $<span style="color: #ab75c3;">1</span> | cut -d <span style="color: #bdbc61;">' '</span> -f <span style="color: #ab75c3;">1</span><span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>

     <span style="color: #656565;"># </span><span style="color: #757575;">...</span>
     -H <span style="color: #bdbc61;">'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9'</span> <span style="color: #bdbc61;">\</span>
     --data-raw <span style="color: #bdbc61;">"${ru_word}"</span> <span style="color: #bdbc61;">\</span>
     --silent <span style="color: #bdbc61;">\</span>
     --compressed | jq <span style="color: #bdbc61;">'.translated'</span> -r<span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>

<span style="color: #528fd1;">echo</span> <span style="color: #bdbc61;">"${count},${ru_word},${en}"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I then added a higher-level script to run this script, line by line&#x2026;
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #656565;">#</span><span style="color: #757575;">!/usr/bin/</span><span style="color: #5180b3;">env</span><span style="color: #757575;"> bash</span>

<span style="color: #528fd1;">echo</span> <span style="color: #bdbc61;">'count,ru,en'</span> &gt; words.csv

<span style="color: #5180b3;">while </span><span style="color: #528fd1;">read</span> line; <span style="color: #5180b3;">do</span>
  ./ru_to_en.sh <span style="color: #bdbc61;">"${line}"</span> &gt;&gt; words.csv
  sleep .5
<span style="color: #5180b3;">done</span> &lt;words.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I did this so that (1) I could stream results easily, (2) for better clarity, and (3) so I could easily <code>sleep</code> between requests &#x2013; it's rude to make 35,000 rapid requests!
</p>

<p>

<p>
Cross-posting a <a href="https://tech.freckle.com/2022/04/07/it-doesnt-have-to-be-arbitrary/">blog post</a> that I wrote on Haskell <code>Arbitrary</code> instances. It's neat to work at a company that encourages writing blogs as part of your day job. <a href="https://freckle.com/en-us/">Freckle</a> rocks.

  <title><![CDATA[Bane Dominion Expansion]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<div id="outline-container-org80faad0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org80faad0">Why Bane?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80faad0">
<p>
I created a <a href="https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion/">dominion</a> expansion based around the <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Bane">Young Witch's bane card</a>.
</p>

<p>
The reason for using "Bane" (e.g. deck modifiers) as the main deck engine is simple. You can print the cards out (using a tool like <a href="https://shardofhonor.github.io/dominion-card-generator/?title=&amp;description=&amp;type=&amp;credit=&amp;creator=&amp;price=&amp;preview=&amp;type2=&amp;color2split=1&amp;boldkeys=&amp;picture-x=0&amp;picture-y=0&amp;picture-zoom=1&amp;picture=&amp;expansion=&amp;custom-icon=&amp;color0=0&amp;color1=0&amp;size=4">the card generator</a>) and use them with your existing cards. No need for fancy card-stock, matching backs, and all that &#x2013; just print them out and play.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgda8021d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgda8021d">General Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgda8021d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bane cards lay under kingdom piles and grant them new behaviors.</li>
<li>Bane cards that grant a card a new type (e.g. <i>Fortification</i>) do this in addition to its existing types though card types remain</li>
<li>Kingdom cards should have at most one Bane modifier</li>
<li>It's recommended to use no more than 3 Bane cards in a kingdom</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

  <title><![CDATA[Toddler Trilemma]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Before I became the parent of a toddler, there were phrases I never imagined myself saying. "Because I said so" and "because that's how it is" are answers that I've never found satisfactory &#x2013; why should a toddler? Well, lo and behold, I find myself using phrases like these more than I'd care to admit as a defense against the endless barrage of <i>why?</i>.
</p>

<p>
The other day, while indulging a particularly long stream of <i>why?</i>, my mind began to wonder and I started to connect the situation to a bit of formal logic I studied eons ago.
</p>

<p>
I don't think about formal logic often but one thing that's always stuck with me is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma">Münchhausen trilemma</a>.
</p>

<p>
This "trilemma" asserts that there are only three ways to actually prove something:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>circular reasoning</li>
<li>infinite regression</li>
<li>argument from authority/axiom</li>
</ul>

<p>
See the connection?
</p>

<p>
Answering "because I said so" is a lot like an argument from authority or an axiomatic argument. In this case, it's so, well, because I said it is &#x2013; I'm the authority.
</p>

<p>
Responding "because that's how it is" is a circular argument, albeit a boring one without any little arguments in between.
</p>

<p>
What about an infinite regression argument? Well logicians, hear us parents out, these don't exist. A toddler's endurance in asking "why?" far surpasses that of the parent in articulating coherent responses. Münchhausen I see your trilemma; meet the Toddler's Dilemma; Occam would be so proud.

  <title><![CDATA[org-mode Blog in spacemacs and Github Pages]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I just published the famous <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/hello-world.html">"hello world" article</a> using
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
As an equally-famous followup, here's the "how I did it" post.
</p>

<p>
To start, I added the <code>org-static-blog</code> package to my <code>.spacemacs</code> file.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">dotspacemacs-additional-packages '<span style="color: #81b0e3;">(</span>org-static-blog<span style="color: #81b0e3;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, I added the generic <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog#minimal-configuration">minimal configuration</a> that the package recommends, substituting values for my specific setup. I set <code>org-static-blog-page-postamble</code> to the empty string because I didn't like seeing duplicate "Other Posts" links.
</p>

<p>
Then I added a new post under my <a href="https://github.com/mjgpy3/me/blob/main/posts/hello-world.org"><code>posts</code> folder</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then I ran <code>org-static-blog-publish</code> and viola, a git add/commit/push later and here we are.
</p>

<p>
To configure Github pages, I went to my repository's "Settings" page and, under the "Pages" tab, I chose the repo's <code>docs</code> folder. <code>docs</code> is where I configured <code>org-static-blog</code> to generate content.
</p>

<p>
But, enough meta-blogging, where's the content?
