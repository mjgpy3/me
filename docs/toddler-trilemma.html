<p>
Before I became the parent of a toddler, there were phrases I never imagined myself saying. "Because I said so" and "because that's how it is" are answers that I've never found satisfactory &#x2013; why should a toddler? Well, lo and behold, I find myself using phrases like these more than I'd care to admit as a defense against the endless barrage of <i>why?</i>.
</p>

<p>
The other day, while indulging a particularly long stream of <i>why?</i>, my mind began to wonder and I started to connect the situation to a bit of formal logic I studied eons ago.
</p>

<p>
I don't think about formal logic often but one thing that's always stuck with me is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma">Münchhausen trilemma</a>.
</p>

<p>
This "trilemma" asserts that there are only three ways to actually prove something:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>circular reasoning</li>
<li>infinite regression</li>
<li>argument from authority/axiom</li>
</ul>

<p>
See the connection?
</p>

<p>
Answering "because I said so" is a lot like an argument from authority or an axiomatic argument. In this case, it's so, well, because I said it is &#x2013; I'm the authority.
</p>

<p>
Responding "because that's how it is" is a circular argument, albeit a boring one without any little arguments in between.
</p>

<p>
What about an infinite regression argument? Well logicians, hear us parents out, these don't exist. A toddler's endurance in asking "why?" far surpasses that of the parent in articulating coherent responses. Münchhausen I see your trilemma; meet the Toddler's Dilemma; Occam would be so proud.
