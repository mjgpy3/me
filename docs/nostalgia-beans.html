<pre class="example">
The other day I grabbed a handful of jelly beans
From my kids' candy basket
The flavors were familiar
Though danties were dormant
They brought me back to times past

Orange - Orange
Reminds me of getting sick after drinking an orange julius.

Yellow - Lemon
Reminds me of eating lemon marange pie at Mimi's with my great grandmother. She thought I stole her pie -- she missed that I ordered the same.

Green - Watermelon
Reminds me of eating sour patch kids with my cousin, driving to the beach.

Black - Licorice
Reminds me of how much I used to dislike this flavor. Because of this I like it now.

White - Pineapple
Reminds me of having my teeth operated on at the dentist's office. This tastes exactly like the numbing agent they used.

Purple - Grape
Reminds me of taking communion as a child -- grape juice.

Pink - Strawberry
Reminds me of eating airheads at Halloween. Hard to place exactly when.

Red - Cherry
Reminds me of Easter with my family -- my childhood home.
