<p>
It's October 31 and what a month it has been! Today, as my last writing exercise of the month, I'm writing the conclusion to my <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/overly-ambitious-october-challenges.html">Overly Ambitious October Challenge</a> series.
</p>

<p>
These challenges have certainly been enriching. As I mentioned in my <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/october-goal-update-1.html">earlier update</a>, these have been difficult to maintain, but they've been nonetheless rewarding. So let's review where I landed with each one.

I completed my first Inktober! This was a lot more fun than I expected. I plan on writing a separate post with a scan of each drawing.
</p>

<p>
I may continue this challenge in a different form. Trying to draw a random Wikipedia article each day could be an interesting exercise.

I managed to land, record, and publish, a trick for each day of the month. Due to weather and time constraints, as expected, I did many of these tricks in the same few sessions. I believe it took four sessions in all to complete the tricks.

<p>

This month I read, in entirety
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Making Comics</i></li>
<li><i>As a Man Thinketh</i></li>
<li><i>I, Robot</i>, and</li>
<li><i>The Storm Before the Storm</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Though I didn't fully complete a fifth book, I also read
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1/3 of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> (quite a feat in itself)</li>
<li>Some <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> aloud to my family</li>
<li>2/3 of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i></li>
<li>1/2 of <i>The Story of My Life</i> (Helen Keller's autobiography)</li>
<li>a little bit of <i>The Two Towers</i> (which I've been reading aloud for some time now)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This goal was wonderful and I hope to continue the pace of reading about a book a week. Of course, engaging with longer books may make this challenging.

I will not be continuing this challenge but will continue to take ad hoc photos.

I did write a little bit of code in my private, Dominion (card game) tracking repository. I also wrote some code to play with the evaluator in "Why Calculating is better than scheming".

This challenge was good but I don't plan on continuing it. Writing is fun and I certainly need to practice it more. Daily writing goals just didn't really do it for me though. I don't feel like I gained a lot and mostly just sped through my writing activities.

This was a good challenge though it was one of the most difficult to keep up. I tended to overdo it on certain days making consecutive days more difficult. This ended up being a pretty even split of (1) body weight training, (2) intense skateboarding sessions, and (3) using a body weight exercise dice.

I will certainly keep up the body weight training but will not do as many days consecutively in the future.

This proved to be quite an interesting month. I mostly enjoyed the challenges and they certainly kept me busy. Given enough free time, I'm not sure I would do another month like this again. Though I've accomplished a lot, trying to fit it all in was a bit overwhelming at times, especially on busier days.
