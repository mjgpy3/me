<pre class="example">
I read a fantasy novel
It had a character called Dogman
Dogman's what they used to call Saint Christopher
They say his people had heads like those of dogs

What kind of a world was that?
Were the dogfaced people a myth?
Did Christopher just look unattractive?

The point is
Honestly
Ancients said dogfaced people were real
They believed it
Some knew it

Does this even seem possible in these days?
Is it even believable that people believed this?
Where has the wonder gone?
Where to O' mystical?
Where wonder?

They are gone

They have been replaced by brutal and blunt material

On the neck of wonder rests the boot of capital
