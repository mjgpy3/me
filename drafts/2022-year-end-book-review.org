* /The Name of the Wind/ (★★⯪☆☆ 2.5/5)
  
Things I didn't like
 - Felt like a collection of side-quests
 - No major resolution for such a long (intro) book
 - Characters felt 1-dimensional (couldn't distinguish his friends, women all seemed like the same character)
 - Lots of repetition: gotta make tuition trope, main character always "realizes female character X is beautiful"
 - Auri (sewer girl) gave off an odd anime, crazy and cutesy vibe and I found myself cringing while reading this character
 - It felt like a Harry Potter wannabe at times
 - Plot was mostly bust with formulaic booms (character takes massive risk then gets a major reward or setback)
 - Some dialog and writing pulled us out of the "fantasy world" into clear early 2010s zeitgeist (e.g. debating modern idioms, character's sensibilities, citing formal logical fallacies)
 - Main character was something of an übermensch
 - Felt like author was projecting his ideals onto the main character
 - Spoilers on the back of the book, kind of, I guess

I think I would have enjoyed this more if I had
 - Entered it expecting young adult fantasy
 - Known it wouldn't resolve anything (and that the second book was so long and third forthcoming)
 - Not read /The Lies of Locke Lamora/ so recently which had similarities but set too high a bar

The book was fan-service to reading. The main character's dream place was the Archives, he was seeking stories and look at the setting. A scribe was transcribing Kovthe telling his story, which at times even included embedded story tellers.
