* /The Complete Short Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

It's difficult to rate a collection of short stories. Even more so, it's difficult to find a collection where each story is as enriching as the next. Well, it's easy for me to give this collection a five, even in toto. Moreover, I assert, no story was any less enjoyable than the next.

Of course, I'm a little biased -- Dostoevsky is my favorite author. Though this is the case, at times I've struggled to finish his longer works. The short stories were wonderful because they were each gripping and, well, short!

* /I'm Thinking of Ending Things/ (★★★⯪☆ 3.5/5)

I had never heard of this book before but I read it for a book club. It struck me as being a postmodern, psychological thriller type of novel. This isn't in my normal line of reading so I reserve the right to be wholly off with that categorization.

I did enjoy it and found myself in suspense at times. It evokes a /spooky/ feeling and contains a few twists and turns. I will mention, however, (at the risk of a spoiler -- skip this paragraph if you don't wanna hear it) I did find the ending to be quite predictable.

As book club books go, it was a pretty good one and spurred some interesting discussions. Around that topic I would so a few things, if you're looking to discuss or watch the movie:
 - the book club questions in the back of the novel are no where near as interesting as they could be.
 - don't expect the movie to be /anything/ like the book. Aside from bearing the same title and having a few events in common, they are practically unrelated.

* /Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)
  
This was a very nice book along the vein of other Orthodox spirituality books I've read in recent years. Elder Thaddeus lived a most interesting life, filled with many spiritual lessons. This book is an expounding thereabouts.

* /The Rust Programming Language/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)

This was a good programming language introduction book. It
 - wasn't dry
 - had compelling examples to muck around with
 - introduces concepts in a logical order and pace, and
 - gave enough of an intro without delving too deep

* /The Republic of Thieves/ (★★⯪☆☆ 2.5/5)

I read this book quickly because I wanted to get to the "good" part. Unfortunately I can't say that there was a good part. It had its entertaining moments, to be sure, but the bar was set too high by the first too books. The first book, /The Lies of Locke Lamora/ is superb. The second book -- a good follow up. This book lost me.

The things that I didn't like were
 - the "political espionage" narrative was dull
 - the "acting troupe" flashbacks were uncompelling (I wanted to skip them as I read them)
 - I predicted every major twist (whereas the first two books constantly surprised me)
 - the love interest character was insufferable
 - I could, at risk of spoiling the book, summarize it in a few sentences
 - the book only yielded one new plot development to the overarching story
 - this plot development could arguably be plot regression (I'm being vague as I don't wanna spoil anything)

* /Endurance/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

This story is gripping. It is, without a doubt, my "book of the year" pick.

The narrative was masterfully synthesized from first-hand accounts. The story is so well presented that it feels like reading stellar fiction.

This story has it all. I laughed, I cried, I get chills thinking about it now. I couldn't put it down.

My refrain when reading this book was

#+begin_quote
It's like those movies where the characters keep surviving impossible situations and you think "there's no way someone could /actually/ live through that!" Except this isn't fantasy -- it's real. And the peril is frequent and only gets more extreme.
#+end_quote

A brief note if you're reading a recent copy: if you don't know how it ends and want to avoid spoilers **defer looking at the pictures in the book until after you've read it**. The pictures contain spoilers!

* /Pushkin Poems/ (★★★★☆ 4/5)

I don't read much poetry but I wanted to change that this year. I figured this would be a good starting place since I enjoy Russian literature and enjoyed reading Pushkin's short stories last year.

This proved to be a good collection. The only difficulty I had with it was that the word-for-word translation doesn't yield the /best/ English. Parts were tricky to understand.

The poem that stood out most from the collection was [[https://russianuniverse.org/2014/09/24/slanderers-of-russia/][Slanderers of Russia]] especially in light of current events.

* /How Design Makes the World/ (★★★☆☆ 3/5)
  
This was a good introduction to design principles. My favorite parts were the anecdotes and examples of design anti-patterns and incongruities.

I would give it a higher rating if it were (1) less preachy, and (2) more substantial. I don't want to get into this here but it's clear that the author and I have competing philosophies of the world.
  
| *Author*                      | Scott Berkun                                                           |

* /On the Cosmic Mystery of Jesus Christ/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

This was a very nice, albeit small, collection of the writings of Maximus the Confessor. I won't get into too many specifics other than to say that his exposition of the story of Jonah really made me think.

| *Author*                      | St. Maximus the Confessor, Paul M. Blowers, et al.                                                                         |

* /Moby Dick/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

I've always felt that this book has a stigma as being stodgy. This couldn't be farther from the truth. This book is wonderful. It's a poetic journey that's filled with comedy, adventure, and a deep exposition of all things whales and whaling.

Speaking of whale exposition, this book has heaps of it. I've heard folks recommend skipping such details and only reading the narrative. I would not recommend this. Though sometimes tangential, the expositions unify and supplement the plot. They're filled with gems and instill gravity to the proceedings.

I learned a ton from this book. Not only about whales but also about good storytelling. I also learned about my many shortcomings. I lost count of the number of historical and mythological references Melville makes that went over my head.

I enjoyed this book and it shows! I read it at the same time as a few other books but managed to finish it in short order.

* /On the Divine Images/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

Though I've heard many of the points made in this book before, I've never heard them presented so well in unity. It was a little repetitive at points but that's how you make a point.

* /Early Christian Doctrines/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)

This was a most challenging book for me this year, if not the most challenging.

What made it challenging?

 - It presented /tons/ of theologies, across many centuries, many of which conflict.
 - These theologies are often not simple. Undoubtedly, I didn't grasp them all.
 - Church history itself is challenging: many figures, views, events, etc...

That being so, I enjoy a challenge. I learned a ton from this book and I will reference it in the future.

Kelly does a nice job citing many primary sources. You'll be sure to learn from this book should you pick this up.

* /Notes from the Underground/ (★★★★★ 5/5)
  
If you haven't figured it out by now, Dosteovsky is my favorite author. I decided to re-read this book as my first [[https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/notes-from-the-underground-audiobook.html][audiobook project]] this year. It's a great book that's equal parts frustrating, touching, thought-provoking and schizophrenic (in all the best ways). It's a short classic that's dense with lessons for moderns.

* /War and Peace/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

What can one say about War and Peace? It's a touching and beautiful book. The translation I read was dense and engaging, which helped me along.

As a humorous aside, I was at page 450 (after about 24 hours of reading) and I decided to check the translator. To my horror I skipped to the publisher page and read, "Translated and abridged by Princess Alexandra Kropotkin". That's right, I read an abridged copy and only figure it out when I was two-thirds through!

But, I'm glad that I read this translation. It may have been a bit jumpy but was, again, engaging and packed with narrative and frequent intrigue. It was good enough that I plan on reading an unabridged version in years to come.

The characters and their interactions make this book. Character arcs are superb. The players reveal themselves through their actions and interactions. You may find that in each third of the book your opinion of a character transforms from disinterest to detest then to pity. By the end, your favorite characters may be those you least expected when you met them.

* /The Name of the Wind/ (★★⯪☆☆ 2.5/5)

I have more notes recorded for this book than for others. Why? It was a book club book, so I wanted to record my thoughts upon finishing reading it.

Things I didn't like
 - Felt like a collection of side-quests
 - No major resolution for such a long book
 - Chapter-ending quips got old quickly
 - Characters felt 1-dimensional (couldn't distinguish his friends, female characters all seemed like carbon copies of each other)
 - Lots of repetition: gotta make tuition trope, main character always "realizes female character X is beautiful"
 - Auri (sewer girl) gave off an odd anime, crazy and cutesy vibe and I found myself cringing while reading this character
 - It felt like a Harry Potter wannabe at times
 - Plot was mostly bust with formulaic booms (character takes massive risk then gets a major reward or setback)
 - Some dialog and writing pulled us out of the "fantasy world" into clear early 2010s zeitgeist (e.g. debating modern idioms, character's sensibilities, citing formal logical fallacies)
 - Main character was something of an übermensch
 - Felt like author was projecting his ideals onto the main character
 - Spoilers on the back of the book, kind of, I guess

I think I would have enjoyed this more if I had
 - Entered it expecting young adult fantasy
 - Known it wouldn't resolve anything (and that the second book was so long and third forthcoming)
 - Not read /The Lies of Locke Lamora/ so recently which had similarities but set too high a bar

The book was fan-service to reading. The main character's dream place was the Archives, he was seeking stories and look at the setting. A scribe was transcribing Kvothe telling his story, which at times even included embedded story tellers. The book also made many specific callouts to other fantasy literature, in passing.

* /Maybe Haskell/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)
  
We read this book at my work in a Haskell programming language learning group. This book, by my estimation, is an excellent appetizer for Haskell. Grab a copy of this book if you want to see Haskell's unique approach to avoiding ~null~.

* /The Blade Itself/ (★★★★★ 5/5)
  
What a great book this was! The pacing is a perfect roller-coaster ride, the characters are despicably enjoyable. The story is intriguing and self aware.

This book felt like a wonderful counterpoint to my points of dislike of /The Name of the Wind/ and /The Republic of Thieves/.

A warning to the sensitive: this book has a lot of violence. Being a modern who grew up on an unhealthy does of modern film I'm a little desensitized to this so I wasn't bothered by it. But you may be.

The more I read this the more I liked some characters and despised others. By my estimation, this is evidence of great character writing.

I liked it more and more as on I read.

* /How To Speak So That People Will Listen/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)

This was a useful, short book that's full of wisdom. The Christian underpinning of the text may be a turnoff for some readers but I found it made the book more complete. It was almost more holistic than a typical "self help" book.

My only criticism of the book is that I wish it had delved more into informal speech. Much of the book focused on formal presentations.

* /Beginning To Pray/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)

This was a nice book on prayer. The book presents and bunch of examples, some of which are quite surprising. It also gives advice and provides a holistic view on prayer. It attempts to, like Lewis, decouple prayer from ceremony and make it part of your life.

I would recommend this book as a book club study book. The book is certainly challenging and thus great for spurring discussion.

I only give it a 4.5 because I found it difficult (at times) to extract lessons from all the content. For such a short book, it contains a lot of lessons.

* /The Chimes/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)

This was a nice book, a very /Dickens/ book. It has much in common with /A Christmas Carol/ and reveals something of a formula. The point is, Dickens' formula works and yields heartwarming tales.

I'm no military strategist but this was a unique and neat read. This was another book I picked up as an [[https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/the-art-of-war-audiobook.html][audiobook project]] and it made for quite an enjoyable read.

* /Starship Troopers/
* /The Millionaire Next Door/  
* /The Wreck of the Whaleship Essex/ (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)

This was a wild story. I decided to read this because I enjoyed /Moby Dick/ so much and I heard that this inspired Melville to write it. Overall I wasn't disappointed, however, I was disturbed at points by what the crew had to undergo.

Being a "survival at sea" story this book had a lot in common with /Endurance/. However, let's just say that this story takes a different turn than Shackleton's journey.

The first mate, Owen's accounting is descriptive and comprehensive. As you're reading his narrative you actually feel as though you're aboard the ships, hoping and struggling for survival.
  
As an aside, I recorded this account as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tuncZYvl_U][an audiobook]]. Before recording I hadn't read this so some of my reactions during the audiobook are genuine.

* /The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring/ (★★★★★ 5/5)
  
This is one of my all-time favorite books. This is the third time I've read it and the second time I've read it aloud to my wife.

It's difficult to even know where to start with a book like this. I grew up on these stories -- they feel like a part of me. It might be an unhealthy attachment but these books bring tears to my eyes, often and regularly. The characters are beautiful, their dialog is splendid, and their world is elaborate.

At this point in my encounters Lord of the Rings, I'm surprised to say that my only regret is that it's difficult to decouple the tales from the Peter Jackson films. Though these films are great, I think they can tunnel your vision of the world presented in the books. That being said, when I read the books aloud, I try to give the characters somewhat different voices than in the films.

But seriously, what a beautiful book full of hope and the epic struggle against evil. These are, in my mind, classics and for good reason.

* /How To Learn A Foreign Language/ (★★★★☆ 4/5)

This was a fine how-to book. I'm in the process of learning a foreign language right now and I figured this would be a nice supplement for the more directed study.

I read this while I was reading /How To Read a Book/ which lessened my opinion of this book. A lot of the author's commentary felt fuzzy and I found the author constantly saying that everything in language is arbitrary (which is silliness and not well backed in the book). The book is also heavily dated to the time in which it was written (e.g. constant references to the USSR).

This book claims to work well for individual learners, however, it's really geared towards learning in a foreign language class. This was another large downside to it.

* /Irish Proverbs/ (★★★★★ 5/5)
  
This was a fine little collection, printed on good paper with nice illustrations. I always wonder how authentic a collection like this is but nonetheless I found myself enjoying the little proverbs.

It's always tricky to review a book like this. The sayings each have a moral or lesson and they're worthwhile to reflect on. That being said, I feel that little books of proverbs are acquired tastes. I personally like them very much.

A few of the proverbs I had heard before, many I had not. My favorite was

* /Before They Are Hanged/ (★★★★★ 5/5)

This was a great followup to /The Blade Itself/. To be honest, though I gave the first book a solid 5/5, I liked /Before They Are Hanged/ a bit more. My only major contention with the book was that I found the, let's say "intimate" scenes quite cridgeworthy. I think they could have been left out, made more tasteful, or even just alluded to.

As with /The Blade Itself/ this book has wonderful characters. A character or two actually have an arc that feels genuine. Each character is distinct and well written.

I thought that I had a hunch of where this book was headed as I was reading it. I learned later in /Last Argument of Kings/ that I was wrong. This is always welcome as I don't consider these books predictable which makes them stand out from many contemporaries in their genre.
