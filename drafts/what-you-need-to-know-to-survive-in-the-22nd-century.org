so we made it, eh

  the 22nd century

things are pretty rough out there

  these simple tips will keep you alive

you only need to just simply trivially

  guffaw over spilled milk

    stomp on the heads of those who are standing on giants' shoulders

      never look at a gift horse

        judge a book by its potential covers

          give n-to-the-n-factorial percent

            make your passion be trying to find your passion

              arrive a day before anyone else and leave a day after

                leave the campground a perfect frictionless physics vacuum

                  wash behind the ears of a thousand orphans

                    just forget about it (and everything else)

                      a GMO apple a day keeps the plague doctor at bay

                        never sleep or you'll miss out on something

                          put your egg in every basket

                            be better than the best you that's in any other multiverse

                              baby, marry the reaper
                            freeze a bunch of your favorite embryos with 'im
                          go dual income with that ol' hooded skeleton
                        maximize your social credit score with him
                      there's nothing else in twenty duo
                    tell him you have no deepest secrets nor thoughts nor feelings nor soul
                  then divorce him
                take half his credit good boy points
              go negative on law fees
            be sure you get his scythe in settlement
          use it to become a humble farmhand 
        work the fields
      earn your keep
    grow strong
  live long
re-marry the reaper
