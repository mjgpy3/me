<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org70f08e7">
<p>
It's difficult to rate a collection of short stories. Even more so, it's difficult to find a collection where each story is as enriching as the next. Well, it's easy for me to give this collection a five, even in toto. Moreover, I assert, no story was any less enjoyable than the next.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I'm a little biased &#x2013; Dostoevsky is my favorite author. Though this is the case, at times I've struggled to finish his longer works. The short stories were wonderful because they were each gripping and, well, short!

<h2 id="org21deb53"><i>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</i> (★★★⯪☆ 3.5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org21deb53">
<p>
I had never heard of this book before but I read it for a book club. It struck me as being a postmodern, psychological thriller type of novel. This isn't in my normal line of reading so I reserve the right to be wholly off with that categorization.
</p>

<p>
I did enjoy it and found myself in suspense at times. It evokes a <i>spooky</i> feeling and contains a few twists and turns. I will mention, however, (at the risk of a spoiler &#x2013; skip this paragraph if you don't wanna hear it) I did find the ending to be quite predictable.
</p>

<p>
As book club books go, it was a pretty good one and spurred some interesting discussions. Around that topic I would so a few things, if you're looking to discuss or watch the movie:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the book club questions in the back of the novel are no where near as interesting as they could be.</li>
<li>don't expect the movie to be <i>anything</i> like the book. Aside from bearing the same title and having a few events in common, they are practically unrelated.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb4fbbc5">
<p>
I read this book quickly because I wanted to get to the "good" part. Unfortunately I can't say that there was a good part. It had its entertaining moments, to be sure, but the bar was set too high by the first too books. The first book, <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> is superb. The second book &#x2013; a good follow up. This book lost me.
</p>

<p>
The things that I didn't like were
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the "political espionage" narrative was dull</li>
<li>the "acting troupe" flashbacks were uncompelling (I wanted to skip them as I read them)</li>
<li>I predicted every major twist (whereas the first two books constantly surprised me)</li>
<li>the love interest character was insufferable</li>
<li>I could, at risk of spoiling the book, summarize it in a few sentences</li>
<li>the book only yielded one new plot development to the overarching story</li>
<li>this plot development could arguably be plot regression (I'm being vague as I don't wanna spoil anything)</li>

<p>
This story is gripping. It is, without a doubt, my "book of the year" pick.
</p>

<p>
The narrative was masterfully synthesized from first-hand accounts. The story is so well presented that it feels like reading stellar fiction.
</p>

<p>
This story has it all. I laughed, I cried, I get chills thinking about it now. I couldn't put it down.
</p>

<p>
My refrain when reading this book was
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's like those movies where the characters keep surviving impossible situations and you think "there's no way someone could <i>actually</i> live through that!" Except this isn't fantasy &#x2013; it's real. And the peril is frequent and only gets more extreme.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A brief note if you're reading a recent copy: if you don't know how it ends and want to avoid spoilers <b><b>defer looking at the pictures in the book until after you've read it</b></b>. The pictures contain spoilers!

<p>
I don't read much poetry but I wanted to change that this year. I figured this would be a good starting place since I enjoy Russian literature and enjoyed reading Pushkin's short stories last year.
</p>

<p>
This proved to be a good collection. The only difficulty I had with it was that the word-for-word translation doesn't yield the <i>best</i> English. Parts were tricky to understand.
</p>

<p>
The poem that stood out most from the collection was <a href="https://russianuniverse.org/2014/09/24/slanderers-of-russia/">Slanderers of Russia</a> especially in light of current events.

This was a good introduction to design principles. My favorite parts were the anecdotes and examples of design anti-patterns and incongruities.
</p>

<p>
I would give it a higher rating if it were (1) less preachy, and (2) more substantial. I don't want to get into this here but it's clear that the author and I have competing philosophies of the world.

I've always felt that this book has a stigma as being stodgy. This couldn't be farther from the truth. This book is wonderful. It's a poetic journey that's filled with comedy, adventure, and a deep exposition of all things whales and whaling.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of whale exposition, this book has heaps of it. I've heard folks recommend skipping such details and only reading the narrative. I would not recommend this. Though sometimes tangential, the expositions unify and supplement the plot. They're filled with gems and instill gravity to the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
I learned a ton from this book. Not only about whales but also about good storytelling. I also learned about my many shortcomings. I lost count of the number of historical and mythological references Melville makes that went over my head.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed this book and it shows! I read it at the same time as a few other books but managed to finish it in short order.

<li>It presented <i>tons</i> of theologies, across many centuries, many of which conflict.</li>

If you haven't figured it out by now, Dosteovsky is my favorite author. I decided to re-read this book as my first <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/notes-from-the-underground-audiobook.html">audiobook project</a> this year. It's a great book that's equal parts frustrating, touching, thought-provoking and schizophrenic (in all the best ways). It's a short classic that's dense with lessons for moderns.

<p>
What can one say about War and Peace? It's a touching and beautiful book. The translation I read was dense and engaging, which helped me along.
</p>

<p>
As a humorous aside, I was at page 450 (after about 24 hours of reading) and I decided to check the translator. To my horror I skipped to the publisher page and read, "Translated and abridged by Princess Alexandra Kropotkin". That's right, I read an abridged copy and only figure it out when I was two-thirds through!

But, I'm glad that I read this translation. It may have been a bit jumpy but was, again, engaging and packed with narrative and frequent intrigue. It was good enough that I plan on reading an unabridged version in years to come.
</p>

<p>
The characters and their interactions make this book. Character arcs are superb. The players reveal themselves through their actions and interactions. You may find that in each third of the book your opinion of a character transforms from disinterest to detest then to pity. By the end, your favorite characters may be those you least expected when you met them.

<p>
I have more notes recorded for this book than for others. Why? It was a book club book, so I wanted to record my thoughts upon finishing reading it.
</p>

<p>
Things I didn't like
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Felt like a collection of side-quests</li>
<li>No major resolution for such a long (intro) book</li>
<li>Chapter-ending quips got old quickly</li>
<li>Characters felt 1-dimensional (couldn't distinguish his friends, women all seemed like the same character)</li>
<li>Lots of repetition: gotta make tuition trope, main character always "realizes female character X is beautiful"</li>
<li>Auri (sewer girl) gave off an odd anime, crazy and cutesy vibe and I found myself cringing while reading this character</li>
<li>It felt like a Harry Potter wannabe at times</li>
<li>Plot was mostly bust with formulaic booms (character takes massive risk then gets a major reward or setback)</li>
<li>Some dialog and writing pulled us out of the "fantasy world" into clear early 2010s zeitgeist (e.g. debating modern idioms, character's sensibilities, citing formal logical fallacies)</li>
<li>Main character was something of an übermensch</li>
<li>Felt like author was projecting his ideals onto the main character</li>
<li>Spoilers on the back of the book, kind of, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I would have enjoyed this more if I had
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Entered it expecting young adult fantasy</li>
<li>Known it wouldn't resolve anything (and that the second book was so long and third forthcoming)</li>
<li>Not read <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> so recently which had similarities but set too high a bar</li>
</ul>

<p>
The book was fan-service to reading. The main character's dream place was the Archives, he was seeking stories and look at the setting. A scribe was transcribing Kvothe telling his story, which at times even included embedded story tellers.

<p>
We read this book at my work in a Haskell programming language learning group. This book, by my estimation, is an excellent appetizer for Haskell. Grab a copy of this book if you want to see Haskell's unique approach to avoiding <code>null</code>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcaf3243">
<p>
What a great book this was! The pacing is a perfect roller-coaster ride, the characters are despicably enjoyable. The story is intriguing and self aware.
</p>

<p>
This book felt like a wonderful counterpoint to my points of dislike of <i>The Name of the Wind</i> and <i>The Republic of Thieves</i>.
</p>

<p>
A warning to the sensitive: this book has a lot of violence. Being a modern who grew up on an unhealthy does of modern film I'm a little desensitized to this so I wasn't bothered by it. But you may be.
</p>

<p>
The more I read this the more I liked some characters and despised others. By my estimation, this is evidence of great character writing.
</p>

<p>
I liked it more and more as on I read.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc8dc94f">
<p>
This was a useful, short book that's full of wisdom. The Christian underpinning of the text may be a turnoff for some readers but I found it made the book more complete. It was almost more holistic than a typical "self help" book.
</p>

<p>
My only criticism of the book is that I wish it had delved more into informal speech. Much of the book focused on formal presentations.

<h2 id="orgc2d350a"><i>Beginning To Pray</i> (★★★★⯪ 4.5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc2d350a">
<p>
This was a nice book on prayer. The book presents and bunch of examples, some of which are quite surprising. It also gives advice and provides a holistic view on prayer. It attempts to, like Lewis, decouple prayer from ceremony and make it part of your life.
</p>

<p>
I would recommend this book as a book club study book. The book is certainly challenging and thus great for spurring discussion.
</p>

<p>
I only give it a 4.5 because I found it difficult (at times) to extract lessons from all the content. For such a short book, it contains a lot of lessons.
