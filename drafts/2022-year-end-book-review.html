<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org46cf8c1">
<p>
It's difficult to rate a collection of short stories. Even more so, it's difficult to find a collection where each story is as enriching as the next. Well, it's easy for me to give this collection a five, even in toto. Moreover, I assert, no story was any less enjoyable than the next.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I'm a little biased &#x2013; Dostoevsky is my favorite author. Though this is the case, at times I've struggled to finish his longer works. The short stories were wonderful because they were each gripping and, well, short!

<h2 id="org06f5498"><i>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</i> (★★★⯪☆ 3.5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org06f5498">
<p>
I had never heard of this book before but I read it for a book club. It struck me as being a postmodern, psychological thriller type of novel. This isn't in my normal line of reading so I reserve the right to be wholly off with that categorization.
</p>

<p>
I did enjoy it and found myself in suspense at times. It evokes a <i>spooky</i> feeling and contains a few twists and turns. I will mention, however, (at the risk of a spoiler &#x2013; skip this paragraph if you don't wanna hear it) I did find the ending to be quite predictable.
</p>

<p>
As book club books go, it was a pretty good one and spurred some interesting discussions. Around that topic I would so a few things, if you're looking to discuss or watch the movie:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the book club questions in the back of the novel are no where near as interesting as they could be.</li>
<li>don't expect the movie to be <i>anything</i> like the book. Aside from bearing the same title and having a few events in common, they are practically unrelated.</li>

This was a very nice book along the vein of other Orthodox spirituality books I've read in recent years. Elder Thaddeus lived a most interesting life, filled with many spiritual lessons. This book is an expounding thereabouts.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8305da6">
<p>
I read this book quickly because I wanted to get to the "good" part. Unfortunately I can't say that there was a good part. It had its entertaining moments, to be sure, but the bar was set too high by the first too books. The first book, <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> is superb. The second book &#x2013; a good follow up. This book lost me.
</p>

<p>
The things that I didn't like were
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the "political espionage" narrative was dull</li>
<li>the "acting troupe" flashbacks were uncompelling (I wanted to skip them as I read them)</li>
<li>I predicted every major twist (whereas the first two books constantly surprised me)</li>
<li>the love interest character was insufferable</li>
<li>I could, at risk of spoiling the book, summarize it in a few sentences</li>
<li>the book only yielded one new plot development to the overarching story</li>
<li>this plot development could arguably be plot regression (I'm being vague as I don't wanna spoil anything)</li>

<p>
This story is gripping. It is, without a doubt, my "book of the year" pick.
</p>

<p>
The narrative was masterfully synthesized from first-hand accounts. The story is so well presented that it feels like reading stellar fiction.
</p>

<p>
This story has it all. I laughed, I cried, I get chills thinking about it now. I couldn't put it down.
</p>

<p>
My refrain when reading this book was
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's like those movies where the characters keep surviving impossible situations and you think "there's no way someone could <i>actually</i> live through that!" Except this isn't fantasy &#x2013; it's real. And the peril is frequent and only gets more extreme.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A brief note if you're reading a recent copy: if you don't know how it ends and want to avoid spoilers <b><b>defer looking at the pictures in the book until after you've read it</b></b>. The pictures contain spoilers!

<p>
I don't read much poetry but I wanted to change that this year. I figured this would be a good starting place since I enjoy Russian literature and enjoyed reading Pushkin's short stories last year.
</p>

<p>
This proved to be a good collection. The only difficulty I had with it was that the word-for-word translation doesn't yield the <i>best</i> English. Parts were tricky to understand.
</p>

<p>
The poem that stood out most from the collection was <a href="https://russianuniverse.org/2014/09/24/slanderers-of-russia/">Slanderers of Russia</a> especially in light of current events.

This was a good introduction to design principles. My favorite parts were the anecdotes and examples of design anti-patterns and incongruities.
</p>

<p>
I would give it a higher rating if it were (1) less preachy, and (2) more substantial. I don't want to get into this here but it's clear that the author and I have competing philosophies of the world.

I've always felt that this book has a stigma as being stodgy. This couldn't be farther from the truth. This book is wonderful. It's a poetic journey that's filled with comedy, adventure, and a deep exposition of all things whales and whaling.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of whale exposition, this book has heaps of it. I've heard folks recommend skipping such details and only reading the narrative. I would not recommend this. Though sometimes tangential, the expositions unify and supplement the plot. They're filled with gems and instill gravity to the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
I learned a ton from this book. Not only about whales but also about good storytelling. I also learned about my many shortcomings. I lost count of the number of historical and mythological references Melville makes that went over my head.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed this book and it shows! I read it at the same time as a few other books but managed to finish it in short order.

This was a most challenging book for me this year, if not the most challenging.

<p>
What made it challenging?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It presented <i>tons</i> of theologies, across many centuries, many of which conflict.</li>
<li>These theologies are often not simple. Undoubtedly, I didn't grasp them all.</li>
<li>Church history itself is challenging: many figures, views, events, etc&#x2026;</li>

That being so, I enjoy a challenge. I learned a ton from this book and I will reference it in the future.

Kelly does a nice job citing many primary sources. You'll be sure to learn from this book should you pick this up.

If you haven't figured it out by now, Dosteovsky is my favorite author. I decided to re-read this book as my first <a href="https://mjgpy3.github.io/me/notes-from-the-underground-audiobook.html">audiobook project</a> this year. It's a great book that's equal parts frustrating, touching, thought-provoking and schizophrenic (in all the best ways). It's a short classic that's dense with lessons for moderns.

What can one say about War and Peace? It's a touching and beautiful book. The translation I read was dense and engaging, which helped me along.
</p>

<p>
As a humorous aside, I was at page 450 (after about 24 hours of reading) and I decided to check the translator. To my horror I skipped to the publisher page and read, "Translated and abridged by Princess Alexandra Kropotkin". That's right, I read an abridged copy and only figure it out when I was two-thirds through!

But, I'm glad that I read this translation. It may have been a bit jumpy but was, again, engaging and packed with narrative and frequent intrigue. It was good enough that I plan on reading an unabridged version in years to come.
</p>

<p>
The characters and their interactions make this book. Character arcs are superb. The players reveal themselves through their actions and interactions. You may find that in each third of the book your opinion of a character transforms from disinterest to detest then to pity. By the end, your favorite characters may be those you least expected when you met them.

<p>
I have more notes recorded for this book than for others. Why? It was a book club book, so I wanted to record my thoughts upon finishing reading it.
</p>

<p>
Things I didn't like
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Felt like a collection of side-quests</li>
<li>No major resolution for such a long book</li>
<li>Chapter-ending quips got old quickly</li>
<li>Characters felt 1-dimensional (couldn't distinguish his friends, female characters all seemed like carbon copies of each other)</li>
<li>Lots of repetition: gotta make tuition trope, main character always "realizes female character X is beautiful"</li>
<li>Auri (sewer girl) gave off an odd anime, crazy and cutesy vibe and I found myself cringing while reading this character</li>
<li>It felt like a Harry Potter wannabe at times</li>
<li>Plot was mostly bust with formulaic booms (character takes massive risk then gets a major reward or setback)</li>
<li>Some dialog and writing pulled us out of the "fantasy world" into clear early 2010s zeitgeist (e.g. debating modern idioms, character's sensibilities, citing formal logical fallacies)</li>
<li>Main character was something of an übermensch</li>
<li>Felt like author was projecting his ideals onto the main character</li>
<li>Spoilers on the back of the book, kind of, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I would have enjoyed this more if I had
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Entered it expecting young adult fantasy</li>
<li>Known it wouldn't resolve anything (and that the second book was so long and third forthcoming)</li>
<li>Not read <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> so recently which had similarities but set too high a bar</li>
</ul>

<p>
The book was fan-service to reading. The main character's dream place was the Archives, he was seeking stories and look at the setting. A scribe was transcribing Kvothe telling his story, which at times even included embedded story tellers. The book also made many specific callouts to other fantasy literature, in passing.

<p>
What a great book this was! The pacing is a perfect roller-coaster ride, the characters are despicably enjoyable. The story is intriguing and self aware.
</p>

<p>
This book felt like a wonderful counterpoint to my points of dislike of <i>The Name of the Wind</i> and <i>The Republic of Thieves</i>.
</p>

<p>
A warning to the sensitive: this book has a lot of violence. Being a modern who grew up on an unhealthy does of modern film I'm a little desensitized to this so I wasn't bothered by it. But you may be.
</p>

<p>
The more I read this the more I liked some characters and despised others. By my estimation, this is evidence of great character writing.

I liked it more and more as on I read.

<p>
This was a useful, short book that's full of wisdom. The Christian underpinning of the text may be a turnoff for some readers but I found it made the book more complete. It was almost more holistic than a typical "self help" book.
</p>

<p>
My only criticism of the book is that I wish it had delved more into informal speech. Much of the book focused on formal presentations.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c09dad">
<p>
This was a nice book on prayer. The book presents and bunch of examples, some of which are quite surprising. It also gives advice and provides a holistic view on prayer. It attempts to, like Lewis, decouple prayer from ceremony and make it part of your life.
</p>

<p>
I would recommend this book as a book club study book. The book is certainly challenging and thus great for spurring discussion.
</p>

<p>
I only give it a 4.5 because I found it difficult (at times) to extract lessons from all the content. For such a short book, it contains a lot of lessons.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbf174f6">
<p>
A few years ago, I listened to this book an a recording. I remembered really liking it and decided to read the physical copy. I don't often read military books or war books but I like a good science fiction piece. This is a very good science fiction piece. It's also a good war book for that matter.
</p>

<p>
I believe some consider this book to be controversial. I can kind of see why, however, I think it raises some good questions and points. I'd definitely like to take some time to read some well formed arguments for or against the ideas herein.
</p>

<p>
From a "plot perspective" this was quite enjoyable. I liked the characters and I liked their interactions.
</p>

<p>
As a brief aside, if you haven't already heard, "Starship Troopers" the movie is absolutely nothing like the book. It's almost a parody of the book.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c814a5">
<p>
As self-help books go, I found this one very good. I've heard this book get some flack due to survivorship bias (i.e. only analyzing millionaires excludes sub-millionaires). Though there's certainly some validity to that argument it's still a very good book. It essentially just encourages thriftiness and avoiding wasting money on status symbol possessions. These, in themselves, are good messages and I found myself changing some of my financial behavior from the patterns described in this book. I'm not a millionaire but I did find that I already follow many of the ideas expressed therein.

<p>
This was a wild story. I decided to read this because I enjoyed <i>Moby Dick</i> so much and I heard that this inspired Melville to write it. Overall I wasn't disappointed, however, I was disturbed at points by what the crew had to undergo.
</p>

<p>
Being a "survival at sea" story this book had a lot in common with <i>Endurance</i>. However, let's just say that this story takes a different turn than Shackleton's journey.
</p>

<p>
The first mate, Owen's accounting is descriptive and comprehensive. As you're reading his narrative you actually feel as though you're aboard the ships, hoping and struggling for survival.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, I recorded this account as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tuncZYvl_U">an audiobook</a>. Before recording I hadn't read this so some of my reactions during the audiobook are genuine.

<p>
This is one of my all-time favorite books. This is the third time I've read it and the second time I've read it aloud to my wife.
</p>

<p>
It's difficult to even know where to start with a book like this. I grew up on these stories &#x2013; they feel like a part of me. It might be an unhealthy attachment but these books bring tears to my eyes, often and regularly. The characters are beautiful, their dialog is splendid, and their world is elaborate.
</p>

<p>
At this point in my encounters Lord of the Rings, I'm surprised to say that my only regret is that it's difficult to decouple the tales from the Peter Jackson films. Though these films are great, I think they can tunnel your vision of the world presented in the books. That being said, when I read the books aloud, I try to give the characters somewhat different voices than in the films.
</p>

<p>
But seriously, what a beautiful book full of hope and the epic struggle against evil. These are, in my mind, classics and for good reason.

<p>
This was a fine how-to book. I'm in the process of learning a foreign language right now and I figured this would be a nice supplement for the more directed study.
</p>

<p>
I read this while I was reading <i>How To Read a Book</i> which lessened my opinion of this book. A lot of the author's commentary felt fuzzy and I found the author constantly saying that everything in language is arbitrary (which is silliness and not well backed in the book). The book is also heavily dated to the time in which it was written (e.g. constant references to the USSR).
</p>

<p>
This book claims to work well for individual learners, however, it's really geared towards learning in a foreign language class. This was another large downside to it.

This was a fine little collection, printed on good paper with nice illustrations. I always wonder how authentic a collection like this is but nonetheless I found myself enjoying the little proverbs.
</p>

<p>
It's always tricky to review a book like this. The sayings each have a moral or lesson and they're worthwhile to reflect on. That being said, I feel that little books of proverbs are acquired tastes. I personally like them very much.
</p>

<p>
A few of the proverbs I had heard before, many I had not. My favorite was
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What butter &amp; whiskey will not cure, there's no cure for.

<h2 id="orge4b52b4"><i>Before They Are Hanged</i> (★★★★★ 5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge4b52b4">
<p>
This was a great followup to <i>The Blade Itself</i>. To be honest, though I gave the first book a solid 5/5, I liked <i>Before They Are Hanged</i> a bit more. My only major contention with the book was that I found the, let's say "intimate" scenes quite cridgeworthy. I think they could have been left out, made more tasteful, or even just alluded to.
</p>

<p>
As with <i>The Blade Itself</i> this book has wonderful characters. A character or two actually have an arc that feels genuine. Each character is distinct and well written.
</p>

<p>
Also in line with the first book, the action sequences were most excellent. It had a gritty feel to it which I'd describe as being Tarantino-esque.
</p>

<p>
I thought that I had a hunch of where this book was headed as I was reading it. I learned later in <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> that I was wrong. This is always welcome as I don't consider these books predictable which makes them stand out from many contemporaries in their genre.

<h2 id="org6aa15eb"><i>The Old Man And The Sea</i> (★★★⯪☆ 3.5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6aa15eb">
<p>
This was a fine read. I know that it's often read in schools and that's probably for good reason. The things I liked in the book were the old man's relationship with the boy and the beautiful illustrations of the sea and sea life. Of course, the writing is clear which is nice.
</p>

<p>
Due to my recent interest in tales about sea faring and whale hunting I really thought that I'd like this book. Hemmingway, though I've heard of him for my whole life, was new to me. The author's renown and this book's critical acclaim are well known. So I was slightly disappointed. The book felt like it kind of dragged on a good deal. The story can be summarized in a sentence or two which created a lot of repetition. I had a good deal of trouble identifying with the characters and the copious amounts Spanish interlaced therein didn't help (since, unfortunately I don't speak Spanish). The writing, though clear, also felt quite robotic at times. Perhaps that's just Hemmingway's style?

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf885a86">
<p>
As mentioned a few times before, I really enjoy Russian literature. This book is a bit unique being by an unknown author and being a spiritual book. It definitely contained some of the feeling that made it akin to other Russian literature I've read. It is almost like a mashup of that and a hagiography or spiritual journey.
</p>

<p>
All in all this was a wonderful little story which itself is like a collection of short stories. It is quite an edifying work and I came away with a little note full of spiritual ideas and quotes. It is well worth the read and quite touching.

This was a wonderful story. I read it to my wife and kids (when they would listen). It took quite a while to read for being such a short book but it was worth it. The illustrations were particularly fun.
</p>

<p>
I could absolutely see the source of influence here. There were very clear elements of this that were transplanted in <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
</p>

<p>
From a read-aloud perspective, this was a decent book. The 19th century English can be difficult at times and a little unnatural. But it was still engaging. There was plenty of intrigue.

<h2 id="org5056895"><i>The Abolition of Man</i> (★★★★★ 5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5056895">
<p>
When I first think of Lewis I remember his children's books, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>. I also sometimes think of <i>Mere Christianity</i>. These books are incredibly simple compared to other works of Lewis, including <i>The Abolition of Man</i>. This book, though short, has many difficulties for me. It has phrases in Latin, Greek, and it's riddled with references to the classics. That being said, this is a most edifying, grounding read, and I believe more people should read it.
</p>

<p>
Lewis' logic is sound. The thrust of the book is an argument that the truth is objective and we need to beware of systems which totally do away with our ancestors' knowledge of the truth. Newly revealed truth should further elaborate known truths, rather than dismissing them. I want to take some time to find flushed out criticisms of the ideas in this book.
