<h2 id="org578de3e"><i>The Complete Short Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky</i> (★★★★★ 5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org578de3e">
<p>
It's difficult to rate a collection of short stories. Even more so, it's difficult to find a collection where each story is as enriching as the next. Well, it's easy for me to give this collection a five, even in toto. Moreover, I assert, no story was any less enjoyable than the next.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I'm a little biased &#x2013; Dostoevsky is my favorite author. Though this is the case, at times I've struggled to finish his longer works. The short stories were wonderful because they were each gripping and, well, short!

<h2 id="org46dc798"><i>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</i> (★★★⯪☆ 3.5/5)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org46dc798">
<p>
I had never heard of this book before but I read it for a book club. It struck me as being a postmodern, psychological thriller type of novel. This isn't in my normal line of reading so I reserve the right to be wholly off with that categorization.
</p>

<p>
I did enjoy it and found myself in suspense at times. It evokes a <i>spooky</i> feeling and contains a few twists and turns. I will mention, however, (at the risk of a spoiler &#x2013; skip this paragraph if you don't wanna hear it) I did find the ending to be quite predictable.
</p>

<p>
As book club books go, it was a pretty good one and spurred some interesting discussions. Around that topic I would so a few things, if you're looking to discuss or watch the movie:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the book club questions in the back of the novel are no where near as interesting as they could be.</li>
<li>don't expect the movie to be <i>anything</i> like the book. Aside from bearing the same title and having a few events in common, they are practically unrelated.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff55791">
<p>
This was a very nice book along the vein of other Orthodox spirituality books I've read in recent years. Elder Thaddeus lived a most interesting life, filled with many spiritual lessons. This book is an expounding thereabouts.

Things I didn't like
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Felt like a collection of side-quests</li>
<li>No major resolution for such a long (intro) book</li>
<li>Characters felt 1-dimensional (couldn't distinguish his friends, women all seemed like the same character)</li>
<li>Lots of repetition: gotta make tuition trope, main character always "realizes female character X is beautiful"</li>
<li>Auri (sewer girl) gave off an odd anime, crazy and cutesy vibe and I found myself cringing while reading this character</li>
<li>It felt like a Harry Potter wannabe at times</li>
<li>Plot was mostly bust with formulaic booms (character takes massive risk then gets a major reward or setback)</li>
<li>Some dialog and writing pulled us out of the "fantasy world" into clear early 2010s zeitgeist (e.g. debating modern idioms, character's sensibilities, citing formal logical fallacies)</li>
<li>Main character was something of an übermensch</li>
<li>Felt like author was projecting his ideals onto the main character</li>
<li>Spoilers on the back of the book, kind of, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I would have enjoyed this more if I had
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Entered it expecting young adult fantasy</li>
<li>Known it wouldn't resolve anything (and that the second book was so long and third forthcoming)</li>
<li>Not read <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> so recently which had similarities but set too high a bar</li>
</ul>

<p>
The book was fan-service to reading. The main character's dream place was the Archives, he was seeking stories and look at the setting. A scribe was transcribing Kovthe telling his story, which at times even included embedded story tellers.
