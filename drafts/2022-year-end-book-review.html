Things I didn't like
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Felt like a collection of side-quests</li>
<li>No major resolution for such a long (intro) book</li>
<li>Characters felt 1-dimensional (couldn't distinguish his friends, women all seemed like the same character)</li>
<li>Lots of repetition: gotta make tuition trope, main character always "realizes female character X is beautiful"</li>
<li>Auri (sewer girl) gave off an odd anime, crazy and cutesy vibe and I found myself cringing while reading this character</li>
<li>It felt like a Harry Potter wannabe at times</li>
<li>Plot was mostly bust with formulaic booms (character takes massive risk then gets a major reward or setback)</li>
<li>Some dialog and writing pulled us out of the "fantasy world" into clear early 2010s zeitgeist (e.g. debating modern idioms, character's sensibilities, citing formal logical fallacies)</li>
<li>Main character was something of an übermensch</li>
<li>Felt like author was projecting his ideals onto the main character</li>
<li>Spoilers on the back of the book, kind of, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I would have enjoyed this more if I had
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Entered it expecting young adult fantasy</li>
<li>Known it wouldn't resolve anything (and that the second book was so long and third forthcoming)</li>
<li>Not read <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> so recently which had similarities but set too high a bar</li>
</ul>

<p>
The book was fan-service to reading. The main character's dream place was the Archives, he was seeking stories and look at the setting. A scribe was transcribing Kovthe telling his story, which at times even included embedded story tellers.
